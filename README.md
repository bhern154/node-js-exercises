# Node Practice

In this exercise, I practice working with Node, NPM, and the **file** API.

It is a simple program similar to the standard UNIX utility, [cat üêà](http://www.linfo.org/cat.html).

## Installation

To get started, install the necessary dependencies:

## Usage

```bash
npm install

# Output to a specified file
node [js filename] [--out] [output-filename.txt] [readfile-or-url]

# Output to the console
node [js filename] [readfile-or-url]
